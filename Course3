Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


santosh kurakula
Algorithm Analysis
This helps us to understand the resource utilization specifically performance and complexity. in the module we learned about three differnt types:
1) Best case 
2) Worst case
3) Average case
By analyzing different algorithms, we can compare them to determine the best one for our purpose.
